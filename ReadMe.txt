Describe how to build your project

The files and the data are present in such a way you can just build the project once you open the project.

Describe how to open your project
to open my project go to NetworkProgramming1\BufferLib and open BufferLib.sln
this will open the project. here you need to choose TCP server and setUp as startup project.
Now you need to run the project without debugging.
The server command line will show up.
Now you need to leave this as it is and go back to visual studio.
Now set TCPClient as the startup Project and launch it without debugging.

TcpClient window will pop up and her you can type in your name and messeges to send to the server.
